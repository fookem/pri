    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Thank you for using Snail Ledger, a bookkeeping application that values your privacy and is committed to providing transparency about how your data is handled. This Privacy Policy outlines our approach to data collection, usage, and storage, and our commitment to safeguarding your personal information.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <p><strong>Snail Ledger does not collect any personal or usage data.</strong> All data you input into the app, including but not limited to transaction records, notes, and preferences, is stored locally on your device. No data is transmitted, stored, or processed on any external servers or by any third-party service providers.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>As all data remains on your device, you have full control over your information. Snail Ledger utilizes local storage solely to enable you to manage your bookkeeping records within the app. There are no analytics or tracking tools embedded within the application that monitor your behavior or usage patterns.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All bookkeeping data is securely stored on your device's local storage. Snail Ledger does not implement any data synchronization, cloud storage, or external backups. It is recommended to use your deviceâ€™s built-in backup solutions to safeguard your data, as Snail Ledger does not offer data recovery services in case of device loss or damage.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are dedicated to ensuring that your data remains secure. Since Snail Ledger does not transfer data to any external servers, your information is as secure as the device on which it is stored. We advise users to enable device-level security measures, such as passcodes or biometric locks, to protect their data.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>Snail Ledger does not share any of your data with third parties. The app does not use any external APIs, social media integrations, or advertising networks that might otherwise access or collect your information. </p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Snail Ledger is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any data, including personal data, from children. If you are a parent or guardian and become aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:foongyokem88@icloud.com">foongyokem88@icloud.com</a>, and we will take steps to delete such information from the device.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We encourage users to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Your continued use of Snail Ledger after any changes to this Privacy Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the changes and your consent to adhere to the updated policy.</p>
